  <p>I went to a private school in Hawaii. Not University of Hawaii, UH is a public University. I attended Hawaii Pacific University where I graduated with a B.S.B.A. degree with a Travel Industry Management Major.</p>

  <p>I loved Hawaii after living in Norway for a year after high school.  In Norway, I studied languages and actually <i>flunked</i> English!  It was because I used too much American slang and not the Queen's English.  Fun tidbit.  I picked potatoes on a farm for work.</p>

    <h2><p>Memorable jobs for me were at Holland America Line, Hyatt Regency Waikiki. I was so fortunate to have a job where I got to do the tours, luaus, scuba, and other fun tourist events.  I met stars working at the Hyatt.  More recent notable jobs are my current part-time job as a table games dealer for West Coast Entertainment, and I worked as a coordinator in the Microsoft Integrator team.  <strong>This is the job which turned me on to coding and lead me here!</strong></p></h2>

<h4>I love walking and playing Pokeman and I love Yoga for flexibility and peace of mind.</h4>
